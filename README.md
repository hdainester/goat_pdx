# Goat Paradoxon (goat_pdx)
Java Console Application to test and prove the validity of the Goat-Paradoxon

## Getting Started
You can download a pre-compiled jar <a href="https://github.com/hdainester/goat_pdx/releases/tag/v1.0">here</a>.

If you want to compile the jar by yourself you can either use the *makefile* directly
(which requires *make* to be installed on your system) or simply take a look at it for reference.

## How to use it
Run the jar like so: `java -jar goat_pdx.jar[ <simCount:int>]`<br />

You may run the app with an optional parameter, *simCount*, which starts the app in
simulation mode and runs it for *simCount* iterations.
